# What is Vexanium?

Vexanium is an open-source (permissionless) public blockchain protocol and smart contract platform that enables developers (startups, corporates, and businesses) to create blockchain based projects. As the third generation blockchain protocol, Vexanium is born to support DApps (Decentralized Applications), DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and many real use cases of blockchain applications for startups, businesses, and corporates. Vexanium is going to make blockchain technology accessible and applicable to enhance various industries.

#### Scalability

Vexanium can accommodate more than 2000 TPS (transactions per second) while most blockchain platforms can only accommodate 10 to 100 TPS.

#### Transaction Fees

Vexanium does not charge transaction fees such as most platforms which usually require transaction fees in every transaction made by users.

#### Consensus

Vexanium will use the DPoS (Delegated Proof Of Stakes) consensus which means Vexanium will prioritize scalability and network performance by using block producers.

#### Progamming Language

Vexanium blockchain will use C++ programming language so the programmer will be easier to create a smart contract using Vexanium blockchain.

#### Anti-theft and Freezing Features

By using DPoS, Vexanium blockchain will be able to update contract codes that are inappropriate or the incorrect one without involving a hard fork.
